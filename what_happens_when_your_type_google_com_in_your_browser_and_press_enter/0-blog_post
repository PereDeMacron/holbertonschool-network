What Happens When You Type https://www.google.com in Your Browser and Press Enter?

DNS Request:
    Browser looks up the IP address for 'www.google.com'. If it’s not in the cache, it asks DNS servers to find it.

TCP/IP Connection:
    Browser uses TCP to establish a connection with Google through a "three-way handshake" to make sure both sides are ready to communicate.

Firewall Check:
    Firewalls (on your device and Google’s servers) check your request to ensure it’s safe and block harmful traffic.

HTTPS/SSL Encryption:
    Since using https://, connection is encrypted using SSL/TLS to keep data secure between user and Google.

Load Balancer:
    Google use a load balancer to distribute traffic across many servers, ensuring fast and reliable responses.

Web Server:
    The request reaches a Google web server, which sends back static files like HTML and CSS.

application Server:
    If dynamic content is needed (like search results), the request goes to an application server that processes the request.

Database:
    The application server might query a database to get information, like search results.

Response:
    The web page is sent back, encrypted again, and your browser displays the page.
